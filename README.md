#Hello!
Notice: the repo name is meant to be just "message-board-react-ui", not uui
This will be a simple message board build using the MERN stack (mongoDB, expressJS, React, nodeJS). This project is not actually part of TheOdinProject, I'm only doing it to supplement my learning.

This project is inspired by the "message board" assignment in TheOdinProject, but that assignment does not cover interacting with a database, and insted of react it used templating laguages.

The frontend will be using the following libraries/frameworks:
Vite + React (as my js framework)
TailwindCSS (as my styling soulution)
Axios (for making api calls easier)

The backend will be running the following libraries/frameworks:
NodeJs (as my js runtime)
Nodemon (so editing the server becomes easier)
Express (to handle routing and middleware)
Mongoose (for interacting with the mongoDB database)
Cors
